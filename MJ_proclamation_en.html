      <h1> New Announcement from MJ</h1>
     <p>Gentlemen, it's been a long time since I've seen you, MJ. </p> 
      <p>This time, it's a message to those of you who are anti-Hollow Live. </p>
      <p>If you ignore this proclamation, you will be punished by heaven. </p>
      <p>It is very frustrating for me that Coco Kiryu had to graduate.
      </p> <p>But we have no choice but to use this frustration to protect the other members. </p>
      <h2>Details of the announcement</h2>
      <p>1. Stop antagonizing people involved in Hololive and trolling on YoutubeLive</p>
      <p>2. Withdraw the release of the Youtube comment troll tool</p>
      <p>3. Retaliate if the above is not carried out. </p> 
      <p>If you were not children, you would be able to make intelligent decisions. The world is laughing at you. </p> 
      <p>The world is laughing at you. </p>
